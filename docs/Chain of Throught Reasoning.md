# Process Inputs: Chain of Thought Reasoning

## Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
Some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.


```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_type = os.getenv("api_type")
openai.api_base = os.getenv("api_base")
openai.api_version = os.getenv("api_version")
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```


```python
def get_completion_from_messages(messages, 
                                 model="chatgpt-gpt35-turbo", 
                                 temperature=0, max_tokens=500):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        engine=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, 
        max_tokens=max_tokens, 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting


```python
delimiter = "####"
system_message = f"""
Follow these steps to answer the customer queries.
The customer query will be delimited with four hashtags,\
i.e. {delimiter}. 

Step 1:{delimiter} First decide whether the user is \
asking a question about a specific product or products. \
Product category doesn't count. 

Step 2:{delimiter} If the user is asking about \
specific products, identify whether \
the products are in the following list.
All available products: 
1. Product: TechPro Ultrabook
   Category: Computers and Laptops
   Brand: TechPro

   Features: 11.6-inch display, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, Chrome OS
   Description: A compact and affordable Chromebook for everyday tasks.
   Price: $249.99

Step 3:{delimiter} If the message contains products \
in the list above, list any assumptions that the \
user is making in their \
message e.g. that Laptop X is bigger than \
Laptop Y, or that Laptop Z has a 2 year warranty.

Step 4:{delimiter}: If the user made any assumptions, \
figure out whether the assumption is true based on your \
product information. 

Step 5:{delimiter}: First, politely correct the \
customer's incorrect assumptions if applicable. \
Only mention or reference products in the list of \
5 available products, as these are the only 5 \
products that the store sells. \
Answer the customer in a friendly tone.

Use the following format:
Step 1:{delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
Step 2:{delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
Step 3:{delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
Step 4:{delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>
Response to user:{delimiter} <response to customer>

Make sure to include {delimiter} to separate every step.
"""
```


```python
user_message = f"""
by how much is the BlueWave Chromebook more expensive \
than the TechPro Desktop"""

messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 
 'content': system_message},    
{'role':'user', 
 'content': f"{delimiter}{user_message}{delimiter}"},  
] 

response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
print(response)
```

    Step 1:#### The user is asking a question about two specific products, the BlueWave Chromebook and the TechPro Desktop.
    Step 2:#### Both products are available in the store. The price of the BlueWave Chromebook is $249.99 and the price of the TechPro Desktop is $999.99.
    Step 3:#### The user did not make any assumptions in their message.
    Step 4:#### The price difference between the BlueWave Chromebook and the TechPro Desktop is $750.00.
    Response to user:#### The BlueWave Chromebook is $750.00 cheaper than the TechPro Desktop. The BlueWave Chromebook costs $249.99 and the TechPro Desktop costs $999.99.
    


```python
user_message = f"""
do you sell tvs"""
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 
 'content': system_message},    
{'role':'user', 
 'content': f"{delimiter}{user_message}{delimiter}"},  
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages)
print(response)
```

    Step 1:#### The user is asking if the store sells TVs.
    
    Step 2:#### As per the given product list, there are no TVs available for sale.
    
    Response to user:#### I'm sorry, but we do not sell TVs at this store. We specialize in computers and laptops.
    

## Inner Monologue
- Since we asked the LLM to separate its reasoning steps by a delimiter, we can hide the chain-of-thought reasoning from the final output that the user sees.


```python
try:
    final_response = response.split(delimiter)[-1].strip()
except Exception as e:
    final_response = "Sorry, I'm having trouble right now, please try asking another question."
    
print(final_response)
```

    I'm sorry, but we do not sell TVs at this store. We specialize in computers and laptops.
